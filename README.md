# JHUGetting-CleaningDataAssingment--
UCI Dataset

Created by Willianto Asalim 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files:
1. run_analysis.R file contains code written in R that 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

2. CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data.

3. tidy_data.txt is the the output tidy data set text format.
